title: Mandatory government apps are coming. Here's the real way to survive them.
---

Every few months, some gobernment rolls out the same idea: "We're installing a mandatory cyber-security app on every new phone... for safety."

It's always framed as anti-fraud, anti-scam, anti-crime. And sometimes, they retreat after backlash, but the idea itself never dies. Because the moment a government can force undeletable code onto your phone, the phone stops being *your* device.

So everyone asks: "How do I disable it?" "How do I block permissions?" "How do I stop it?"

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **You don't.**

If the state can put an app on your phone, they can silently reenable permissions, push updates, and monitor anomalies. Fighting it directly makes you stand out.

So the real strategy isn't outright rebellion. It's signal management. Blending in publicly while protecting your private self elsewhere.

Here's how that actually works.

## Keep the government-surveillance phone

Use it exactly how they expect.

This is your identity phone, your public phone, your gorcery store phone.

Do your:

- banking
- WhatsApp with your mom
- food delivery
- wholesome vanilla memes
- doctor appointments

Make it aggressively normal.

In surveillance systems, the safest signal is **boringly predictable.**

Trying to "go dark" is like shouting at them that you're a person they should be interested in.

## Don't wage war against the spyware

You will lose, and losing makes noise.

Disabling permissions, force-stopping the app, deleting logs, all of that creates forensic red flags.

Your adversary isn't some bored data analyst. It's the system that detects patterns.

A long string of "noncompliant behavior" is more suspicious than anything you could say.

So let the surveillance phone be the surveillance phone. Stop treating it as your private diary.

## Anything sensitive should never touch that phone

Not even once.

Don't use your main phone for:

- political discussion
- dissent
- whistleblowing
- activist planning
- vulnerable conversations
- private research
- anything that would harm you if logged

Modern phones are snitches by design. Mandatory apps just formalize it. So don't feed the snitch.

## Build a separate environment for your real life, quietly

This is not getting a second SIM card. This is not your "encrypted apps" folder. I mean a **second device** that lives outside the surveillance graph:

- an old phone bought second hand, wiped clean, used only on Wi-Fi (if that evades the mandatory apps)
- a minimalist laptop with no personal accounts
- an offline-first notes system
- a Tor-only environment (like a Tails OS boot key)
- anything that never intersects with your identity phone's personal metadata trail

Think of it like this. Your main phone is the front window. Your second device is the room with the curtains closed. Different spaces, different rules, no shared footprints. Ideally, you won't even use them in the same physical locations.

## Never let your two worlds touch

This is the part where people slip.

No:

- sending files between them
- logging into the same accounts
- using the same phone numbers
- syncing across clouds
- cross-referencing contacts
- browsing the same links

Intersection = correlation. Correlation = identification.

keep your two identities as separate as two strangers on a train.

## So yes: you can still use your phone

You just can't trust it.

Mandatory government apps don't make your life unlivable. They make your phone **a stage.**

You smile onstage. You act normal onstage. Your private life happens backstage, off-device, off-network, off-pattern.

Once you understand that distinction, you stop fighting surveillance the wrong way and start living safely in spite of it.

## Final thought

Privacy isn't what you can hide on the device they control. Privacy is what you choose not to put there in the first place.

Your phone becomes your costume. Your self lives somewhere else.
