title: So the state wants your ID - here's your toolkit (series hub)
---

They started with a wedge. They'll keep widening the gap. This series isn't about outrage, it's a practical toolkit for people who want to keep reading, learning, and belonging without handing a regulator their passport.

Below is the short, sharp hub: what each post contains, why it matters, and how to use the series.

# Background

The UK's new age/identity checks are rolling out in ways that sweep far beyond any single topic. Whatever you care about - community forums, health resources, fiction, art - identity-gated access is a civil-liberties problem. This series cuts through the noise: concepts first, then **what works right now**. No techno-mysticism. No fetishization of a single tool. Practical defense, layered for resilience.

# The series (read in any order, but this is recommended)

## 1. VPNs Aren't Dead: A Smarter Survival Guide

Link: [https://privacydork.github.io/vpns-arent-dead](https://privacydork.github.io/vpns-arent-dead)

A concise, pragmatic rundown of which VPN properties actually matter under active blocking (obfuscation, audits, flexible ports, split-tunnel), vendor shortlist, operation habits, and a simple testing checklist. Use this as your first-stop tactical quickfix.

## 2. Beyond VPNs - Tor, Bridges, and Trickier Escape Routes

Link: [https://privacydork.github.io/beyond-vpns](https://privacydork.github.io/beyond-vpns)

When VPNs get fingerprinted or blocked, this explains the next tier: Tor + bridges (obfs4, Snowflake), domain-fronting caveats, and proxy-chaining tradeoffs. Practical decision matrix: which tunnel for which problem.

## 3. Your Browser Is Snitching on You - Fingerprint Resistance 101

Link: [https://privacydork.github.io/snitches](https://privacydork.github.io/snitches)

Browser fingerprinting 101 plus high-return controls: use Tor Browser as intended, hardened Firefox (arkenfox) for daily privacy, letterboxing/window discipline, JS control, WebRTC hygiene, and a monitoring checklist (Cover Your Tracks/AmIUnique).

## 4. Own the Library: Mirrors, IPFS, ZIMs & Offline Copies

Link: [https://privacydork.github.io/offline-library](https://privacydork.github.io/offline-library)

The irreversible piece: mirrors, ZIM/Kiwix archives, IPFS pinning, WebTorrent for media, and how to build a resilient mirror/pinning workflow. Practical "do it tonight" checklist for archiving content.

## 5. OPSEC for the Ordinary Rebel

Link: [https://privacydork.github.io/opsec](https://privacydork.github.io/opsec)

A compact operational-security playbook: threat-model template, compartment manifest (personal/public/high-risk), burner-device rules, comms choices, payment hygiene, metadata scrubbing, and endpoint hardening. Simple rituals that multiple your safety.

# How to use this hub

1. Skin the VPN post if you need a quick fix right now.
1. Read Tor/Bridges next if you're seeing ISP-level blocking.
1. Do the Browser Fingerprint checklist before you try any circumvention tool. Your browser will out you faster than any IP block.
1. Mirror and archive anything you can't afford to lose.
1. Layer OPSEC practices into your routine and treat them like hygiene, not heroics.

# Just to say I said so

This series explains privacy tools and operational hygiene for lawful, civil-resistence, and personal-protection purposes. Circumvention can carry legal risks in some jurisdictions. This is not legal advice. Whenever possible, pair technical defenses with legal advocacy: contact your representatives, support digital-rights NGOs, and demand transparency and minimization from providers.

# Final note

This is not about defending "bad content" or content of any kind. It's about refusing a world where bureaucracies gate everyday information behind identity pipelines. The most effective defense is technical and political: protect yourself, then push back publicly. Build mirrors, teach neighbors, support the advocates in govermnet and the courts.
