title: OPSEC for the Ordinary Rebel
---

You don't need to be a spook to protect yourself. You need a simple habit loop: 1. Model the threat, 2. Compartmentalize, 3. Use the right tools for the task, 4. Reduce metadata, and 5. Practice leave-no-trace routines. Do those five things consistently and you'll multiply the work required to deanonymize you by orders of magnitude.

Below: an explanation of each principle, the realistic tradeoffs, and an action checklist you can deploy right now.

# 1. Start with a small, clear threat model

If you can't name who you're protecting against and what they want, you'll waste effort. Pick one of these and design for it:

- **Casual scraper/creeper** - wants your email, social graph, or DMs.
- **Platform compliance team** - wants to tie an account to your real-world identity.
- **ISP or nation-state censor** - wants to block or trace your traffic.
- **Legal/law-enforcement process** wants evidence linking you to an act.

For civil-society ops, your threat model often sits somewhere between "platform complaince" and "ISP/censor." Explicitly listing what would hurt you (exposed home address, payment trail, device geolocation) helps you prioritize protections. (OPSEC primer: identify critical information, analyze threats, assess vulnerabilities, apply mitigations.)

**Action:** write a one-paragraph threat model for the activity you care about. If you can't do that, don't proceed.

# 2. Compartmentalize like a librarian, not a relief pitcher

Compartmentalization is the single most effective habit. Separate identities, devices, and networks so an accidental link doesn't explode into a chain reaction.

- **Separate identities:** different emails, different browser profiles, different phone numbers, different payment method. [Security in a Box](https://www.securityinabox.org/en/assess-plan/multiple-identities) has practical guidance on creating and protecting multiple online identities.
- **Separate devices:** your everyday laptop = one sphere. Use a dedicated device (or live USB) for high-risk browsing. Tails/Whonix or a live Linux session are good for ephemeral tasks; VMs can help if you know what you're doing. [Whonix docs on upstream isolation](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation) explain why you don't want different identities leaking onto the same Tor circuit.
- **Separate networks:** never use your burner device on your home Wi-Fi or the same coffee-shop table where you always sit. Location correlation is real.

**Tradeoff:** more compartments = more friction. Do the minimum number that removes single-point failure: personal/public/high-risk is a common 3-bucket split.

# 3. Communications: choose the right channel for the risk

There's no perfect messaging app. Pick based on threat and metadata risk.

- [Signal](https://signal.org/) is a solid default for private, low-latency messaging with strong end-to-end encryption and wide adoption (good for small groups).
- [Matrix (Element)](https://element.io/) and [Wire](https://wire.com/en/) have tradeoffs around federation, E2EE implementation, and metadata; they can be better for self-hosting and group collaboration when configured correctly. Evaluate server logs and federation risks before trusting them for sensitive comms.
- Check out our [Pseudonymity Starter Kit](https://privacydork.github.io/pseudonymity-starter-kit/) for more suggestions.

**Action:** for most private ops use Signal for 1:1/small-group chats; consider Matrix for asychronous, self-hosted group spaces where metadata control matters and you can run your own server.

# 4. Burners, alt-devices, and how to use them without blundering

Burner phones and prepaid SIMs are useful, but they're a trick that's easy to blow if you're sloppy. Wired's recent guide is a good primer: buy with cash if you need plausible anonymity, don't power the phone on near places you frequent, and don't tie the number to your real accounts.

Practical rules:

- Buy away from home and activate away from usual locations.
- Don't log into your real accounts on a burner device.
- Keep the burner offline or use public Wi-Fi only when necessary; put it in a Faraday bag when not in use.
- After the job, retire the SIM/device, but remember that disposal leaves clues; consider physical destruction for high-risk operations.

**Tradeoff:** convenience vs safety. Burners add friction, so use them intentionally for things that matter. **Assume that providers and others will know you're using a burner device. The key is that they don't know it's YOUR burner device.**

# 5. Payments & financial trails

Money talks. Traditional bank transfers and most exchanges leave long, auditable trails. If your threat model includes law enforcement or financial surveillance, plan the payment flow carefully.

- **For privacy-aware users:** self-custody crypto (and privacy-preserving protocols) can help, but they have limits: on-ramps/off-ramps to exchange fiat for crypto often trigger KYC/AML. Expect regulatory pressure to tighten these chokepoints.
- **P2P markets** and escrow services reduce reliance on exchanges but require operational caution and reputational vetting.

**Action:** pick the lowest-friction privacy-preserving method that fits your legal comfort zone: prepaid cash > privacy-respecting payment rails > careful crypto trading. Document your rationale.

# 6. Metadata hygiene

You can hide your IP or your browser fingerprint, but metadata (who messaged whom, when, and from roughly where) often tells the story. Reduce accidental leakage:

- Use ephemeral accounts for sensitive comms: don't reuse handles.
- Avoid sending large files from your main account; use pinned mirrors or ephemeral hosting.
- Time your actions to avoid habitual patterns (don't always post at 2:00 AM from the same cafe).
- Remove EXIF from images and strip metadata from documents before uploading.

**Action:** run a small audit. Pick three recent public interactions of yours and note what metadata it reveals. If any item ties different compartments together, fix it.

# 7. Physical & device hygiene

Device compromise is a one-way ticket to exposure. Harden the endpoint:

- Keep OS/software patched.
- Use full-disk encryption and strong passphrases.
- Use hardware-backed keys (YubiKey) for high-value accounts when possible.
- Don't carry high-risk devices in places where they can be seized; consider a strong, plausible deniability plan for device searches.

If you need ephemeral anonymity, use live systems (Tails) or an air-gapped workflow; if you need persistent but private access, use a disposable Vm or a secondary device carefully compartmentalized.

# 8. Practice the simplest OPSEC rituals now

These five rituals give a huge return on time invested:

1. **Threat-model note:** write a one-paragraph threat model for your task.
1. **Compartment checklist:** create three profiles/devices: personal, public, high-risk. Use them.
1. **Metadata scrub:** run images/docs through a metadata stripper before upload.
1. **Comm hygiene:** move sensitive convos to Signal or a vetted Matrix room, don't mix accounts.
1. **Fallback & archive:** mirror any content you depend on (small ZIm or IPFS pin) so you don't need risky repeat access.

If you do these five things consistently, you'll be in the top 5% of people who don't accidentally get doxxed.

# 9. Legal & ethical realities

OPSEC advice reduces risk, but it doesn't grant immunity. Circumvention and privacy tactics exist in legal gray areas in many jurisdictions; disguising location or bypassing access controls can carry legal consequences in some places. Always weigh the legal risks and consider non-technical remedies (advocacy, contacting government representatives, supporting NGOs) alongside your technical defenses. For crypto or financial moves, regulatory frameworks (KYC/AML) are tightening - plan accordingly.

# 10. Quick reference checklist

- Write a one-paragraph threat model.
- Create three compartments: personal/public/high-risk.
- Use Tor Browser or Tails *for anonymous browsing;* use hardened Firefox for daily privacy.
- Use Signal for small private groups; self-host Matrix for controlled group spaces ifyou can.
- If you need a burner phone: buy with cash, activate away from home, don't link accounts, retire after use.
- Don't reuse payment rails that expose identity; prefer cash or carefully planned crypto P2P channels.

# Closing

OPSEC isn't ritual magic. It's boring, repetitive, and quietly effective. The goal isn't absolute invisibility - that's impossible. The goal is to make exposing you expensive, slow, and boring enough that attackers move on. Do the basics, keep your head, and keep sharing the lessons that work.
