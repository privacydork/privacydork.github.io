# BritCard or Bust: How to push back against digital ID schemes

The UK is back at it. Another shiny "digital identity" proposal is on the table, sold as convenience, modernization, efficiency. Scan once, prove everything. Neat.

But here's the thing: digital identity infrastructure isn't just about logging in faster. It's about control. Once governments centralize identity, the temptation is irresistable: expand it, link it, weaponize it. History tells us this isn't speculation. it's inevitablility.

## Why it's dangerous

Digital IDs aren't neutral tools. They're surveillance scaffolding. A few highlights:

- **Single point of failure** - one breach, one hack, and millions of people are exposed.
- **Mission creep** - "prove you can work" becomes "prove you can live." These systems only grow in scope. What happens when the definition of who's allowed to work changes to exclude people who oppose the current national party in power?
- **Built-in exclusion** - don't have the right phone, paperwork, or trust in the system? You're out.

## What you can do right now

### 1. Push back socially and politically

- **Make noise early.** Share articles, write your MP, fund groups like Liberty UK or Big Brother Watch. Awareness before rollout matters most.
- **Frame the fight properly.** This isn't "if you've got nothing to hide." It's "nothing to hack, nothing to abuse, nothing to exclude."
- **Guard against creep.** Watch every attempt to expand usage - from benefits checks to travel restrictions. Push back before it normalizes.
- **Support better alternatives.** Self-sovereign identity, decentralized proofs, strict data-minimization. Even partial improvements matter.

### 2. Harden your own privacy (wherever you live)

- **Compartmentalize your life.** Separate work, personal, and activist identities. Different emails, numbers, even devices.
- **Encrypt everything.** Full-disk encryption, password managers like Bitwarden or 1Password, hardware keys like YubiKeys.
- **Resist data hunger.** Decline optional ID checks. Push back when companies ask for more than they need.
- **Control your transactions.** Use cash where you can. Learn censorship-resistant digital money like Monero or Bitcoin Lightning.
- **Minimize surveillance drag.** Firefox or Brave for browsing. Signal, Session, Simplex, DeltaChat or others for messaging. DuckDuckGo or Startpage for seraching.

### 3. Play the long game

- **Support open tech.** Decentralized networks, mesh projects, and open-source identity solutions are your allies.
- **Educate your circle.** Share guides, run workshops, post threads. Knowledge is friction against control.
- **Keep your own vault.** Store critical info offline: guides, tools, emergency docs. Don't bet your freedom on a server you don't control.

## Bottom line

Digital IDs are marketed as convenience. But convenience is the velvet glove, control is the iron fist inside.

The real choice isn't between a plastic card and a smartphone app. It's between autonomy and dependency. Between building our own resilient systems, or letting the state hold the master key to our lives.

Push back. Harden up. Don't wait until the ID becomes mandatory to realize you're already locked in.
