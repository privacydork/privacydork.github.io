title: VPNs Aren't Dead: A Smarter Survival Guide
---

Misguided and tyrannical beaureaucrats are trying to make you prove who you are just to look at ordinary things online. Your knee-jerk reaction might be "use a VPN". That's not wrong, it's just naive. VPNs can still work, but only if you understand which ones, why, and how to use them without handing your privacy to some free service or sacrificing your operational security.

This guide tells you what matters right now, why it matters, and what to watch for tomorrow.

# What a "good" VPN actually means

When you're facing deliberate blocking or DPI (deep-packet inspection), a VPN's basic IP-hiding is not enough. Look for **three real properties:**

- **Obfuscation/stealth (anti-blocking)** - The VPN hides its traffic so it looks like ordinary HTTPS, making it harder to fingerprint and block. Vendors advertise this as "stealth", "obfuscation", or some custom obfuscated tunnels. Proton VPN and others ship these features.
- **String, audited privacy practices** - No-logs policies with independent audits and clean legal jurisdiction matters. A VPN that lies about logging or is forced by local laws to keep metadata is a libability. Recent audits are a signal to favor.
- **Flexible connection options** - TCP 443 support, split-tunneling, and the ability to change endpoints/ports quickly are tactical necessities when blocks ramp up. Many privacy-focused providers expose these features.

**Red flags:** free VPNs, vague privacy policies, VPNs headquartered in data-retentive jurisdictions with weak transparency, or services that require invasive personal payment and identity checks. If the business model is "sell your data", you're buying the product with your privacy.

# Vendors that make sense right now

No recommendation is forever. Pick a provider for the features above and be ready to switch if it gets throttled, blocked, or starts logging.

- [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com) - Swiss jurisdiction, ongoing audits, and an explicit "stealth"/obfuscation offering for difficult censorship conditions. Good privacy posture.
- [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net) - Minimal account model, bridge/bridge-mode options, and privacy-first design (cash and anonymous payment options historically). Useful where you need bridge-style access.
- Surfashark/Nord/Express (commercial picks) - Often show up in tests for reliability and obfuscation; they're pragmatic choices for users who need device coverage and streaming capability, but check audits and jurisdiction. (See aggregator reviews for up-to-date performance comparisons.)

You can pick one of these as your primary and one as a fallback; redundancy is sanity.

# How to use a VPN *smartly*

I'm not dumping configs into your lap. You want reliable outcomes. Here's how to think about getting them.

## Use obfuscation/stealth when you need it

If a provider offers a "stealth" or "obfuscation" mode, use it for sessions that could trigger age-checks or site-level blocks. These modes are explicitly designed to look like ordinary HTTPS and dodge DPI pattersn.

## Rotate endpoints regularly

Don't let a single exit IP become your permanent fingerprint. Rotation reduces the change that a site adds that single IP to a blocklist.

## Split tunneling: minimize exposure

Only send the risky traffic through the VPN. Route the rest of your browsing normally to reduce performance hits and lower the likelihood of cross-linkage between your real accounts and your "circumvention" sessions.

## Prefer audited, transparent providers

Independent audits and a clear jurisdictional story reduce the chance that a provider is compelled to log or hand over customer metadata under pressure.

## Avoid the free VPN trap

Free VPNs make money by monetizing you. They often log, inject ads, or sell data. Use reputable paid services where possible.

# Tests and monitoring: know when you've been detected

A good habit is to keep a short checklist for "Is my VPN being fingerprinted?". Slow page loads on obfuscated servers, sudden forced reCAPTCHA, repeated identity prompts, or sudden failure to reach the same endpoints you used yesterday are signals. If you see them frequently, change provider or switch to a different circumvention layer (Tor bridges, proxy chain, etc.).

# Risk matrix - what a VPN protects you from and what it doesn't

**Protects from:** Casual ISP logging, simple IP blocks, and opportunistic snooping by cafes/guest networks.

**Doesn't protect from (by itself):** Site-level account linkage (your login, cookies, or browser fingerprint), endpoint compromise, or legal processes that compel providers to hand over records (unless they truly can't because of no-logs + jurisdiction). Combine VPN use with good fingerprint resistance and OPSEC>

# When to stop relying on just a VPN

If your ISP or the regulator is selectively blocking all obfuscated VPN traffic (and they can, it happens), treat a VPN as one layer in a stack, not the stack. When that day comes, move horizontally: Tor bridges, proxy chains, or decentralized mirrors become the next options.

# Testing checklist

Before you rely on a setup:

- Confirm the provider supports a "stealth/obfuscation" mode.
- Confirm split-tunneling and custom port options exist (if you need them).
- Check the provider's transparency page or recent audit.
- Run a basic leak test from a privacy test page (DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks). If leaks show, fix or change the setup.

# Legal and ethical note

Circumvention exists in a gray zone. In some jurisdictions, aggressive evasion tactics can draw legal risk. If you're advising others publicly, couch operational advice with clear warnings and suggest legal alternatives when available (advocacy, legal challenges, contacting elected officials, supporting digital-rights groups). At the same time, practical privacy measures for everyday life (avoiding data-sucking free Wi-Fi, using a reputable VPN for general privacy) are reasonable, proportionate steps that many people take to reduce surveillance.

# Bottom line

VPNs aren't a fetish. They're a tool. Use one that respects privacy, configure it intelligently, and always treat it as one layer of a defense.
