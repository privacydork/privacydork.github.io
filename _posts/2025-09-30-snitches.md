title: Your Browser Is Snitching on You - Fingerprint Resistance 101
---

Your browser is loud. It broadcasts a parade of tiny facts: OS, fonts, extensions, screen size, audio stack, micro-timings that together, form a fingerprint. Even if you hide your IP behind a VPN or Tor, that fingerprint will happily point at you. If the state (or a gatekeeper of some other kind) wants to know who's looking, they don't need your passport; they just need to check whether your browser looks like the other ones.

This is about survival, not purity. We're going to focus on the simplest, highest-return moves you can make to stop being an obvious target.

# Browser fingerprinting: the blunt truth

- Fingerprinting is **aggregation**: tiny, boring bits of data combined to create a nearly-unique ID.
- Tools can test how unique you look; use them to baseline and monitor. (EFF's "[Cover Your Tracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/)" and [AmIUnique](https://amiunique.org/privacy-tools/) are the classic tests.)
- Absolute anonymity is a myth. The goal is **blend, reduce and compartmentalize** so you're not the only one who matches a profile.

# The core principles

1. **Uniformity beats spoofing.** Tor's approach is instructive: give users the *same* fingerprint bucket rather than pretending to be different. That's why Tor Browser ships with anti-fingerprinting measures like letterboxing (grouping window sizes) and standardized behaviors. When everyone looks the same, trackers can't tell who's who.
1. **Don't be a special snowflake.** Fancy fonts, unusual extensions, desktop plugins, odd window sizes, and inconsistent timezone or language settings are all identifiers. Less variety = better anonymity.
1. **Scripts are the attack vector.** JavaScript is how most fingerprinting collects entropy (cancas, audio, fonts, GPU). Disable it where you can, or block and control it tightly. EFF and privacy guides repeatedly point to script control as the single most effective defense.
1. **Spoofing is risky.** Fake or randomizing certain attributes can actually *increase* uniqueness because most users don't spoof. Tools that "lie" about your fignerprint tend to paint a flashing neon target. Privacy projects recommend minimizing spoofers and focusing on standardization and blocking instead.

# What to run today

- [Tor Browser](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/anti-fingerprinting/) (as shipped): your first line for high-stakes, low-convenience browsing. Don't install extensions into Tor Browser; use it as intended. It uses letterboxing, anti-fingerprinting defaults, and safe networking defaults.
- [Firefox + arkenfox user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) for hardened everyday browsing: if you need a more usable daily browser, Firefox hardened with a maintained user.js (arkenfox) gives a strong privacy posture and reduces many fingerprinting channels while keeping functionality. It's a good middle ground for people who need both privacy and usability.
- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) if you want a pre-hardened, drop-in privacy browser without doing the user.js work yourself. It trims telemetry and tightens defaults (good for less technical users).
- Tails/Whonix (VM) for compartmentalized, high-safety workflows: [Tails](https://tails.net/) for ephemeral sessions (live USB) and [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) for Tor-in-a-VM use cases. Use these when you absolutely cannot have data persist on the host.

# Settings & habits that move the needle

- **Use Tor Browser for anything that must be anonymous.** Don't try to "morph" another browser into Tor; use the tool designed for the job.
- **Don't install extensions in Tor Browser.** Extensions change the fingerprint surface and are an easy fingerprint vector.
- **Keep window sizes standard.** Maximize or resize wildly and you leak. Tor's letterboxing exists for ar eason.
- **Block or tightly control JavaScript on sensitive sites.** Script blockers (NoScript-like behavior) dramatically reduce fingerprint surface; the tradeoff is site breakage. Use disposable sessions for high-risk browsing.
- **Disable WebRT where you're concerned about local IP leaks.** WebRTC can leak private IPs even behind VPNS. Disable it in browser settings or via hardened user.js preferences.
- **Keep fonts and plugins minimal.** Avoid installing strange system fonts just to "look nicer." Extra fonts are a fingerprint vector.
- **Use separate browser profiles** for different roles: personal, work, circumvention. Don't mix logins that bridge identities.

# What *not* to do

- **Don't trust "randomizer" extensions as your primary defense.** They can make you more unique. Privacy projects advise against relying on spoofing as a main strategy.
- **Don't monkeypatch Tor Browser** with random flags unless you know the exact tradeoffs. Tor devs tune for anonymity at scale; small chagnes can wreck your protection.
- **Avoid using free "privacy" browsers that ship proprietary patches** without transparency. Open-source, auditable projects are better.

# Quick checklist you can run right now

1. Download **Tor Browser** from [torproject.org](https://torproject.org). Use it for sensitive browsing and don't add extensions.
1. If you need a hardened daily driver, install **Firefox + arkenfox user.js** or **LibreWolf** and follow their setup guides.
1. Disable WebRTC (or confirm it's disabled) in the profile you use for circumvention.
1. Run EFF's **Cover Your Tracks** and **AmIUnique** to see how unique you appear. Record a baseline and then iterate.
1. Create separate browser profiles for separate identities (work, personal, etc.). Don't cross-login.

# Testing and monitoring

Use the EFF Cover Your Tracks and AmIUnique tests periodically. If your "uniqueness" score shoots up after a change, roll it back or investigate which attribute blew up. Automated monitoring of key indicators (canvas hash, WebGL vendor, timezone, plugins) is useful if you manage many devices.

# Final note

Fingerprint resistence isn't about a secret extension or a magic toggle. It's an operational discipline. **Use the right tool when you need anonymity, harden a sane daily browser for most browsing, and compartmentalize everything else.** Don't chase gimmicks. Focus on reducing surface area, standardizing your footprint, and practicing good OPSEC.
