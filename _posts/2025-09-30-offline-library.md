title: Own the Library: Mirrors, IPFS, ZIMs & Offline Copies
---

If the state is building fences, your job is to build *replication*. Mirrors, archives, and peer-to-peer distribution aren't romantic technobabble, they're survival. The fewer single points of control for content, the harder it is for a regulator (or a contractor with a checklist) to tell you *you can't read that.*

This post explains the practical chocies for keeping content available: when to mirror, when to ZIM, when to pin to IPFS, and which peer-to-peer tricks actually help. Expect to update your toolchain regularly as the landscape changes. But the principles remain static.

# Why mirrors & decentralization matter

Centralized hosting = one legal subpoena, one delisted domain, one compliance vendor, one outage. Distribute the thing and you force the censor to fight an army of hosts, devices, and offline copies. That's the whole point. Archive seeds survive censorship; centralized gates don't.

# Three tactical strategies

## 1. Create portable, offline archives (ZIM/Kiwix)

For books, encyclopedias, wikis, or long articles: ZIM files are designed for offline distribution and work with Kiwis (desktop, mobile, and local server). If you want other people to carry your content on USBs or microSD cards, ZIMs are the right format. The [OpenZIM project](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/Build_your_ZIM_file) documents how to build custom ZIMs.

## 2. Mirror to resilient central services (Internet Archive & friends)

Put a copy on [archive.org](https://archive.org) (it accepts uploads and collections) so there's an accessible public mirror that's hard to erase completely and easy for researchers to cite. Archive collections can be organized and requested once you've uploaded a body of items.

## 3. Add content to decentralized networks (IPFS + pinning, WebTorrent)

- [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/quickstart/pin/) gives you content-addressed files that can be hosted by many nodes; use pinning services or run your own node to keep CIDs available. The IPFS docs explain pinning and the pinning-service model.
- [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) (browser-compatible BitTorrent over WebRTC) can make media playable directly in browsers and allow peers to share content without centralized servers. For streaming media to peer audiences, WebTorrent is fast and convenient.

# Practical workflows that work *right now*

Pick a target (single article, whole forum section, a small website) and use one or more of these chains.

## Small site or page -> ZIM (offline distribution)

- [Mirror the target locally](https://gurjitmehta.wordpress.com/2017/04/04/mirroring-websites-using-wget-httrack) (wget, HTTrack, or a site crawler) to create a static copy.
- Convert the static opy or curated pages into a ZIM using [OpenZIM tooling](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/Build_your_ZIM_file) (useful for Wikipedia-like content or collections of articles). Distrubte ZIM files; users open them in Kiwix.

## Large media (video/audio) -> WebTorrent + seedbox

- Seed video files via [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/desktop) (desktop or web client). It streams in-browser for peers and reduces your bandwidth costs. Use a small always-on seedbox (or a VPS) to keep at least one reliable seed up.

## General collection -> IPFS + pinning

- Mirror content locally (wget/httrack)
- `ipfs add` the directory and publish the root CID [https://docs.ipfs.tech/quickstart/pin](https://docs.ipfs.tech/quickstart/pin). Then pin with a remote pinning service (or your own IPFS cluster) so the content remains available even if your local node goes offline. Use the standardized Pinning Service API to talk to commercial pinning providers.

## Public archival -> Internet Archive

- Upload static backups or compressed ZIMs to [archive.org](https://archive.org) to create a public, citable mirror. Collections are possible once you hit modest thresholds and coordinate with Archive staff.

# Tools & quick picks

- [wget/HTTrack/curl](https://gurjitmehta.wordpress.com/2017/04/04/mirroring-websites-using-wget-httrack) - mirror and fetch content. Use `wget --mirror` or HTTrack for structured crawls. (Basic archiving.)
- [OpenZIM/Kiwix](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/Build_your_ZIM_file) - build and open ZIM files for offline distribution. Great for wikis and long-form text.
- [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/quickstart/pin) (go-ipfs or ipfs-desktop) - add content, get a CID, and serve it. Combine with a pinning service so content stays live.
- [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/desktop) (desktop/browser) - for streaming media and simple peer seeding.
- [WARC tools](https://anarc.at/services/archive/web) (wayback tools, warcprox) - for robust archival workflows if you need HTTP metadata preserved.

# Operational notes & pitfalls

- **Legal caution.** Mirroring and distributing copyrighted material without permission can be illegal. Don't be reckless; prioritize public-domain, permissively licensed, or content that you have the right to archive. Also be conscious of local laws about circumventing access controls. This isn't legal advice.
- **Content size and cost.** Big collections cost storage and bandwidth. IPFS pinning services and seedboxes cost money; plan for that if you want long-term availability. 
- **Data integrity.** Use checksums and sign manifests so users can verify files haven't been tampered with. Content addressing (IPFS CIDs) helps, but you still want signed indexes and GPG verification where appropriate.
- **Discoverability.** A mirror that no one can find is useless. Publish mirror CIDs, seed magnet links, Archive.org links, and ZIM download mirrors in trusted channels. Consider an index page that lists all mirrors/links and signs that index.
- **Redundancy.** One seed isn't enough. Pin the CID at multiple services, keep a VPS seed, and encourage community seeding.

# Quick actions to do right now

1. Pick a small target (5-20 pages) you care about. This website makes a good test target.
1. Mirror it locally with `wget` or HTTrack. Cofnirm the static copy renders.
1. Convert or package what you need a a ZIM (if it's mostly text), or add the directory to IPFS and pin it.
1. Upload a copy to Internet Archive (optional but recommended) so there's a public, trusted mirror.
1. Publish links (CID, magnet, Archive URL, ZIM download) to your trusted channels and seed with at least one always-on host.

# Where this fits in with a broader strategy

Mirrors and decentralized copies are the *irreversible* piece of resistance: once you distribute a ZIM to hundreds of thumb drives and pin a CID across multiple services, censorship gets expensive and slow. Combine this with the other posts on this blog (VPNs, Tor, fingerprint resistence, OPSEC) and you get usable, resilient access. Don't treat any single method as the whole plan.
